# RISCV-SingleCycleCpu


## This is a singleCycleCPU which supports 40 basic integer instructions.

### It is just my class HomeWork, it probably cannot be used in any real scene. Just Have fun.


#### Note: If you are one of the students in WHU-Cai Zhaohui's Computer Organization and Design,Please don't use my source code to commit.(You can just try, and my first commit time will show the truth)
You can take an example to finish your own singleCycleCpu,That's welcomed.
And if any problems, JUST ISSUE ME!
